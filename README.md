Cyber Security Attack Detection
# UNSW-NB15 Dataset

The UNSW-NB15 dataset consists of raw network packets created by the IXIA PerfectStorm tool in the Cyber Range Lab of the Australian Centre for Cyber Security (ACCS). It was designed to include a mix of real modern normal activities and synthetic contemporary attack behaviors.

## Data Collection

- **Tool Used:** Tcpdump
- **Total Size:** 100 GB of raw traffic (Pcap files)
- **Features:** Nine types of attacks including Fuzzers, Analysis, Backdoors, DoS, Exploits, Generic, Reconnaissance, Shellcode, and Worms.
- **Feature Generation:** Utilized Argus, Bro-IDS tools, and twelve algorithms to generate 49 features along with class labels.
